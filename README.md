What do the authors mean by the term ‘Industry 4.0’ - give two examples?

Industry 4.0, also referred as fourth industrial revolution, is the shift in industries towards digitalisation through bringing automation, connectivity and intelligence as compared to the mechanical and analog process in the third industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 focuses on bringing the technology to make machines self-reliant, communicate with each other and handle big data that human can’t in order to increase efficiency and growth. (AMFG, 2019) The technology includes:
1.    Internet of things
2.    Big data
3.    Cloud computing
4.    Additive manufacturing
5.    Advanced Robotics
6.    Augmented and virtual reality
7.    Cybersecurity technology
8.    Artificial intelligence
9.    Simulation and digital twins
10. Horizontal and vertical systems (Graham, 2020)
 
Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.

One of the examples of the technical risk of the business model driven by industry 4.0 is the attack on the power plant in Saudi Arabia in 2017. The attackers used the malware dubbed “triton” to take control of the plant connected through internet and shutting down the system that resulted in damage to the equipment and infrastructure. (Samuel, 2017)
Furthermore, the attack on Equifax, one of the largest crediting reporting company of USA, suggested data security risk associated with industry 4.0. The attack exposed personal data of approximately 143 million of individuals through attackers gaining access through vulnerability in the open source software framework. (Sara, 2017)

Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study.

An article by Yadong on A general framework of digitalization risks in international business highlighted similar risks due to industry 4.0 but categorised them differently as digital interdependence risks, information security risks and regulatory complexity risks. All highlighting different types of risks associated with digitalisation through industry 4.0. (Yadong, 2021)
